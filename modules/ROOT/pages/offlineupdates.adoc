= Offline Updates

Offline updates are updates which are installed during a reboot or shutdown. On Fedora KDE, this is the default for system updates installed through Discover.

=== Why are offline updates the default?

Offline updates are the default on Fedora KDE, because they increase stability. During a system update, important components of apps can get replaced with newer versions. Installing system updates while Fedora is up and running may lead to those applications causing weird behavior or even crashing in worst cases. To avoid this, system updates require a reboot by default on Fedora KDE.

=== How to deactivate offline updates?

To deactivate offline updates, open System Settings and go to System â†’ Software Update and set Apply system updates to Immediately.
